## 🔐 Important Security Notes

### ✅ Files That Will Be Uploaded
- Source code (React components, Express routes)
- Configuration files (package.json, vite.config.js)
- Documentation (README files)

### ❌ Files That Will NOT Be Uploaded (Protected by .gitignore)
- `node_modules/` - Dependencies (too large, can be reinstalled)
